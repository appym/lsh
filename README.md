Locality Sensitive Hashing with MinHash

Implementation of Minhash Algorithm.(Minhash.java) 
Jaccard Similarity is then computed on the result of the minhash signature matrix.

Example LSH implemnentation. (LSH.java)

The algorithm is currently tailored for 2 documents. In the future it can be improved to match N documents.
